The following sites are using Photologue to manage their images. If you're using Photologue and would like to have your site linked just send me an email with the URL and a description of the site.

Biola University's student student newspaper site is among several planned University sites to use Photologue for image management. Developed from concept to completion in about a month, the Biola University site is a great example of rapid development with Django and a personal point of pride that some of my code helped make this possible.

photo gallery -- I spent some time to create a custom view to display
photos with the next and previous but then ended up not having to use
it when I put thickbox on the gallery display."

Pinax is a Django project intended to provide a starting point for websites. By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your site different.

The website and the projects are currently available in
