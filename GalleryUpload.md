The GalleryUpload model is a simple hack that allows the user to upload an archive (.zip only right now) of images into a Gallery.

You can either select an existing Gallery or a new Gallery will be created from the  "Title" field. Photos will be added with the supplied caption, is\_public status and tags and titled using the pattern "`[`Title`]` `[`number`]`".
